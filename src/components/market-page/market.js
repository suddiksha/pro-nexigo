                    Light Electric vehicles are the primary mode of
                    transportation in densely populated areas across all
                    continents. Globally, Over 100 million 2-wheelers and
                    3-wheelers are on streets everyday covering over 300 million
                    kilometers each day which is equivalent to a Round trip from
                    Earth to Sun. Reducing carbon emissions from these vehicles
                    is a challenge NexiGO energy has taken up. NexiGO’s
                    technology is the key contributor to achieve global
                    electrification faster. Our Innovative designs brings
                    reliability, faster charge times, and safety to the energy
                    source for the vehicles.
